>### Introduction to Financial Frauds
  Financial fraud can be broadly defined as an intentional act of deception involving financial transactions for purpose of personal gain. It is an issue that has wide reaching consequences in both the finance industry and daily life. Fraud can reduce confidence in industry, destabilize economies, and affect people's cost of living. This can be done through a variety of methods such as identity theft or investment fraud.
  For  most  countries,  money  laundering  and terrorist  financingraise  significant  issues with regard to prevention, detection and prosecution. Sophisticated techniques used to launder money and finance terrorism add to the complexity of these issues.
